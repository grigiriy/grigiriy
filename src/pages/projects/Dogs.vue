      full_text="This project started as a joke. When the quarantine starts in russia, there were only a couple of ways to go outside. Dog walks - one of them. The joke was quite simple - I create a website, where people can rent out dogs for a walk. I want to push it for medias 'to get likes and respect'. But then I realized that, we've got a problem in our society - lots of kennels and homeless dogs and I decided to pivot the project. And Here it is."
